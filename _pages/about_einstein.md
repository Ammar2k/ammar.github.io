Hello! I'm Muhammad Ammar, a beginner in Data Science with a strong foundation in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Most of my journey has been self-learned, and I'm currently focused on creating applications using LLMs as reasoning engines. My passion lies in utilizing Deep Learning techniques to address applied problems and create useful outcomes. Committed to the principle of lifelong learning, I am constantly evolving, gaining new knowledge, and enhancing my skills.
